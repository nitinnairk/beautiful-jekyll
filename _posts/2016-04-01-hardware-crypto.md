title: Public Key Encryption Based Sensor Data Encryption/Decryption
---

Implemented Diffie-Hellman key exchange based module in Atmega8 which encrypts the temperature sensor data and sends it to the receiver module, connected via USART, which then decrypts this sensor data which is displayed on an Arduino via SPI.
