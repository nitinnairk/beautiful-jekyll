title: Evaluation of Relation Extraction using Distant Supervision
---

Evaluated dataset extracted using Distant Supervision by finding the vectors of sentences and their Shortest Dependency Paths (SDP) using Doc2Vec and visualizing these high dimensional vectors which may lead to a process by which the inherent noise of distant supervision maybe reduced.
