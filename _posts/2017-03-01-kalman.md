title: Kalman Filter assisted Indoor Positioning using Bluetooth LE
---

* Implemented a system which uses the Kalman Filter smoothened RSSI value of a device to estimate the distance followed by the location using trilateration, which is done by nonlinear least square estimation.
* Curve fitting is done on the training data to get the parameters needed, for distance estimation, during runtime sequence and all communication between nodes is done using MQTT with a Mosquito broker.
