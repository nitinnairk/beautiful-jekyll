Built an IoT device which monitors the electricity usage of the home through a module attached to the digital electricity meter provided by TNEB. The Wi-Fi module is used to connect the device onto the internet. The data obtained is sent using the MQTT public broker service. The MQTT payload is then received by a Node Red cloud app hosted on the IBM Bluemix service which then sends the payload to various services like Emoncms, Twitter and Xively.
