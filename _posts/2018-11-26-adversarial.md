title: Black-Box Adversarial Machine Learning
---
This project was completed as part of the coursework for CS/ECE 5584: Network Security.
For this project black-box adversarial models in two domains namely, vision and text, were built. In doing so, we show the susceptibility of both traditional and deep learning based models to adversarial attacks.
