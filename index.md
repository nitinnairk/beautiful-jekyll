**Hello!**

I'm an extremely passionate engineer who loves to learn and therein build new things. My primary academic area of interest is in machine learning especially NLP and CV. I'm fascinated by multi-modal learning schemes especially with an online distributed approach as Iâ€™m intrigued by its potential impact in both biomedical and large-scale information ingestion systems. I'm also interested in hardware architectures for Deep Neural Networks.
