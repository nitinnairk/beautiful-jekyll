**Hello!**

I'm an extremely passionate engineer who loves to learn and therein build new things. My primary academic area of interest lie at the intersection of genomics and machine learning. I'm fascinated by multi-modal learning schemes especially with an online distributed approach as Iâ€™m intrigued by its potential impact in both biomedical and large-scale information ingestion systems. I'm also interested in hardware architectures for Deep Neural Networks.<br/>
My long-term goal is to build a clinical decision system that ingests various multimodal data so as to help maintain quality of care.
